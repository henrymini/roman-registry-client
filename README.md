For this project, I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I used atom as a text editor and grunt as a task manager. 

This project started primarily in the API, as I thought it was important to have the back end up and running before I tried feeding things to it. After filling out the back end and testing it with curl scripts, it was just a matter of adding some buttons and filling out the nessasary Javascript.  

I hope in the future to be able to return to this project and add more functionality. I would like to potentially add a unit resource that belongs to a general and a user. If I could get that to work, I might add larger legions of units to a generals possession.

as a user, i want to be able to sign up
as a user, i want to be able to sign in
as a signed in user, i want to be able to change my password
as a signed in user, i want to be able to sign out 
as a user, i want to be able to CRUD leaders
as a user, i want to be able to see all of the leaders along with some basic info at a glance
